shadPS4's current minimum requirements are:

CPU:

* A processor with at least 4 cores and 6 threads
* Above 2.5 GHz frequency
* A CPU supporting the x86-64-v3 baseline. 
* Intel: Haswell generation or newer
* AMD: Excavator generation or newer
* Apple: Rosetta 2 on macOS 15.4 or newer

        

GPU:

* A graphics card with at least 1GB of VRAM
* Keep your graphics drivers up to date
* Vulkan 1.3 with the VK\_KHR\_swapchain and VK\_KHR\_push\_descriptor extensions

RAM:

* 8GB of RAM or more

OS:

* At least Windows 10, Ubuntu 22.04, or macOS 15.4

These requirements are minimums. They will make booting games possible, but more demanding 3D games will still struggle. As always, having as powerful a PC as possible is best.
