Short answer: We don't know either.
Long answer: shadPS4 is currently in very early stages, and most of its development revolves around finding innovative ways to translate the PS4’s rendering into Vulkan. To that end, all advancement in compatibility at the moment is fueled by breakthroughs, which are unpredictable, both in when they'll be implemented, and in what games they might affect. You might be waiting one day for your favourite game to be playable, in other cases you might need a year. We simply cannot give an ETA.
