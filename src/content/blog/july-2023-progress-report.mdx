Hi to all,

Although progress is quite slow due to my primary work , there is some progress on shadps4 emulator.

The main focus of developing is on getting a simple ps4 sdk demo to work (videoout\_basic.elf) . This appears to be a quite simple graphical demo.

So what is the progress on it so far?

*   It loads using elf loader
*   Resolve,patch and rellocate all neccesary libraries-functions in HLE . Most of the function are dummy atm.
*   Executes code up to the first unimplemented HLE function (at the time running this report is sceKernelMapDirectMemory function.

So what’s next?

Implementing some more HLE functions and getting the demo proccess further. Optimal goal is to get it running by the end of August.

Can it run/load other demos or commercial games?

Well shadps4 supports elf,self loading but since developing is focused on that particular demo it probably won’t do something interesting . Most probably it will get stucked in resolving unimplemented HLE functions.
