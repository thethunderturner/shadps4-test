As always, you can check out the full changelog \[here]\(https\://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/compare/v.0.9.0...v.0.10.0).

The big new feature this release brings with it is readbacks, which emulates shared memory on the PS4 by reading back memory that was modified on the GPU back to the CPU side, enabling a lot more games to function properly, fixing vertex explosions in Bloodborne and similar games, almost fully fixing climbing on Trico in The Last Guardian, and much, much more. It isn't enabled by default though, you'll have to turn it on manually in the config file yourself, as this is still a very experimental feature, and will break some games, plus it comes with a not insignificant hit to performance as well.
