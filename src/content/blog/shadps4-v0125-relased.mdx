Some would say, "why a new release this early"? While releases came every 2-3 months before, the previous 0.12.0 release had an input change, which made multiple games unplayable, so we needed to patch it quite early. With that, some other interesting features and bugfixes came from development continuing as before, so enjoy ;)
