Another exciting release coming from shadPS4 team . A lot of new features (FSR,HDR) and a lot fixups in this new release . It is really a special day for me since it is my birthday as well (shadow) and 24 years after first pcsx2 release.

It is amazing to see what this team has accomplish since my previous anniversary release. From some openOrbis demos last year we went to having a lot of commercial games running (yes not only bloodborne). Hoping next release will bring even more games working ;)
