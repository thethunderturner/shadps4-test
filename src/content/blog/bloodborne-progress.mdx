As already probably figured out from the posts around , we continue to improve slowly but stable the bloodborne game. In this new video posted below we have Avplayer working (Avplayer is streaming library that plays mp4 files on ps4) , and some graphics improvements .

Still we are far from making this game playable (although Dark Souls that uses similar engine already has some ingame graphics) but we progressing slowly to give you more every day.

Stay tuned for more updates soon.
