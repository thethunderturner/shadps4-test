title: Introducing shadPS4-QtLauncher
---

Today we introduce a new Launcher for shadPS4 , the [shadps4-qtlauncher](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4-qtlauncher) .

Since we had some limitations in our implementations and code was kinda borked in the main repo , we decided to separate shadPS4 emu from its interface . From version 0.12.0 onward, shadPS4 will be command line option only . But don’t worry shadps4 qtlauncher is here to fill the gap. It is extracted from the shadps4 core , so actually there isn’t a big difference in what you have seen before and it has already some nice improvements , like the versions manager which allows to install and have multiple shadPS4 versions at once . It also has update system ready , meaning that you don’t need to download different versions of qtlauncher every time, you can just update the existing one.

So what you are waiting for? go grab your copy on the download section and give us your thoughts , either on our discord or forum page.
