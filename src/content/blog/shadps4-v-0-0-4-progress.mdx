We have a very interesting progress on our new W.I.P. version .

Most of retail games comes with bundled libc and libfios2 libraries . Until version 0.0.3 shadps4 was HLEd part of libc library . From now on if game provides a bundled libc and libfios2 libraries we load it natively. That means we can be more accurate on libc emulation (we saved the need of more than 3000 hle functions) which can make us progress faster!

Stay tuned for more progress report soon!
