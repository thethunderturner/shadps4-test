One of our contributors , Daniel , added support for cheats and patches on shadps4 latest WIP version.

**Cheats**  
Right-click on a game and select the ‘Cheats/Patches’ option. From there, you can download cheats from three repositories: wolf2022, GoldHEN, and shadPS4. If a cheat is available in more than one repository, you can delete the undesired file using a specific button. Cheats will only be downloaded for the specific serial and version of the installed game and will be renamed with the format serial+version+repository.

In the top menu, under “Settings -> Utils -> Download Cheats/Patches”, you can download all cheats at once for the installed games. It is recommended to apply cheats only during gameplay.

**Patches**  
In addition to cheats, you can also download patches. Unlike cheats, patches are downloaded for all games, not just one specific game. The patch file is quite small. Right-click on a game, select ‘Cheats/Patches’, go to the patches tab, check the patches you want to use, and click ‘Save’. This ensures that these options will be applied automatically every time the emulator is started, without needing to reopen the panel. In the Patches tab, if you hover over them you can see the description on the left side.
